This is a project for The Odin Project. The goal is to create a simple Rock paper scissors game
where the player must enter their choice and have the computer play along.

I created this game early on and was anxious to use all of the CSS I could. It's admittedly a little over the top but it was a fun experience and really got me some good exposure to HTML, CSS and JS.
